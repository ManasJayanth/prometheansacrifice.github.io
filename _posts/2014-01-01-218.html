<p>Just out of college and about to get your first job? All your friends boast about sky high corporate salaries they plan to get after their Masters and maybe you've chosen small startup to work at - just because you love it there. You probably were a bright student, maybe you still are but the world around you doesn't acknowledge it. Amidst all these self-doubt, you chose what you love and not a big fat salary?</p>
<p>At TED,Â  Career Analyst Dan Pink talk explains about traditional rewards - financial incentives and why they've failed in the past. Not that they are completely futile - Mr. Pink also explains what they excel at.</p>
<p>Fact remains that it is intrinsic motivation that leads to more productivity - work environments that provide intrinsic motivation are more productive. We're all driven by the desire to do things because they matter, because we like it and because we believe it can be a part of something bigger than ourselves.</p>
<p>No, this talk isn't meant to make you feel better as a fresher getting into the professional world - its actually about what business should really be doing given all the evidence provided by behavioral scientists. So whats in it for you? Well I think it'll help you understand what you're looking for in the long term.</p>
